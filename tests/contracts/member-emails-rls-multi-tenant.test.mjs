/**
 * GAP-205.A contract test — member_emails RLS multi-tenant isolation
 *
 * Static analysis tripwire over migration files. Validates the policy
 * surface that protects `public.member_emails` from cross-tenant reads.
 * Issue: #205 (P162 #116 GAP-205.A) — council Tier 1 PR #240 finding that
 * the original behavioural test (member_emails.test.mjs Step 7) only
 * exercised the no-Authorization-header path. The RESTRICTIVE policy
 * `member_emails_v4_org_scope` was never asserted.
 *
 * Why static analysis (not behavioural):
 *   - The two-policy combination on `member_emails` is PERMISSIVE(false)
 *     + RESTRICTIVE(auth_org()). PostgreSQL evaluates RLS as
 *     `(any PERMISSIVE = true) AND (all RESTRICTIVE = true)`. Because
 *     PERMISSIVE always returns false, no direct client path (anon,
 *     authenticated same-org, authenticated different-org) can ever
 *     return rows. The RESTRICTIVE policy is dead-code at the SQL layer
 *     but encoded as belt-and-suspenders documentation of intent.
 *   - A behavioural test would need to mint JWTs for two different orgs,
 *     observe the deny path, and assert empty results. The deny path is
 *     already covered by PERMISSIVE(false); the RESTRICTIVE policy adds
 *     no observable behaviour beyond PERMISSIVE(false).
 *   - Codebase convention (multi-org-isolation.test.mjs +
 *     rls-auth-org-caller-derived.test.mjs) is to assert policy text
 *     against migration files. This test follows that pattern.
 *
 * What this guards against:
 *   - Future migration drops the PERMISSIVE(false) policy → table becomes
 *     readable by authenticated clients.
 *   - Future migration relaxes the RESTRICTIVE org_scope to remove
 *     auth_org() — cross-tenant reads become possible if PERMISSIVE is
 *     also relaxed.
 *   - GRANT SELECT is re-granted to anon or authenticated → direct
 *     client SELECT becomes possible.
 *
 * Cross-ref:
 *   - ADR-0095 §3 (Security and RLS)
 *   - Migration 20260802000008 (initial policies + grants)
 *   - Migration 20260802000009 (REVOKE SELECT FROM authenticated)
 *   - P162 #116 GAP-205.A (docs/audit/P162_GAP_OPPORTUNITY_LOG.md)
 *
 * Scope: static analysis on migration text. Fast, no DB env required.
