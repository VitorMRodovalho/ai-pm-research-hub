-- #333 (Wave 4 of #221/#218 decomposition): add invariant AK_voice_biometric_consent_enforcement
-- to check_schema_invariants(). Defense-in-depth periodic detector for voice-biometric consent
-- (LGPD Art.11) drift — complements the write-time trigger trg_pmi_video_screening_voice_consent.
--
-- Naming: the issue called it "invariant U", but as of the 37-invariant set the U_ code is held by
-- U_active_person_has_primary_chapter_affiliation. This uses the next free code AK (after AA..AJ).
--
-- Path (b) (PM decision 2026-06-27, per #332's pre-documented tree): ships reporting the true count
-- against a 1-row allowlist baseline (the #332 retroactive-notification candidate, tacit Art.18
-- retention; deletion remains exercisable indefinitely). No candidate identifier is hardcoded here —
-- the detector computes drift dynamically; sample_ids is populated at runtime only.
--
-- Whole-function CREATE OR REPLACE rebuilt from the latest capture (mig 20260805000232) + the AK
-- block, so the body-hash drift gate sees mig …259 as the new latest capture matching the live body.
