## 🧱 DATA / ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATIONS

### Approved architectural direction

- `members` is the current snapshot for identity, contact, auth, and current state.
- `member_cycle_history` is the historical fact table for role, tribe, and cycle participation.
- `operational_role` and `designations` are the target fields.
- `role` and `roles` are tolerated only during migration.
- The Hub remains the only source of truth for gamification and operational metrics.

### Required next technical steps

- [x] Complete frontend reads from `operational_role` and `designations`.
- [x] Render cycle history timeline from `member_cycle_history`.
- [ ] Add and validate `deputy_manager` visual treatment and ordering rules.
- [x] Define hard drop window for `role` and `roles`.
- [ ] Add consent aware analytics instrumentation without leaking PII.

---

## 📊 ANALYTICS GOVERNANCE

### Internal product analytics
Use PostHog through protected iframe dashboards. Do not build custom charts in Astro unless there is a very strong product need.

### Required analytics rules
- use `member_id` or at most `operational_role`
- do not send email or full name unless strictly required
- mask all input fields in session replay
- maintain operational delete path for right to be forgotten
- restrict `/admin/analytics` by tier

### External communication metrics
Use Looker Studio for YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram funnel style KPIs through low maintenance connectors and automation.

## 📋 RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER

### Sessão 1 — House on fire first
1. Unificar Source of Truth de trilha vs gamificação (`S-HF6`)  
2. Corrigir loading infinito das abas secundárias em `/gamification` (`S-HF7`)  
3. Deputy PM hierarchy validation  
4. Smoke test routes and direct navigation  

### Sprint operacional imediata — 2026-03-08 to 2026-03-12
1. Monitorar pós deploy de `S-HF6` e `S-HF7` com amostragem de membros com e sem `credly_url`.

### Próxima sprint recomendada — 2026-03-12 to 2026-03-19 (Wave 3)
1. Entregar `S-RM2` (Completeness Bar & Timeline) com dados 100% em `member_cycle_history`.  
2. Avançar `S-RM3` (Gamification v2) com separação explícita de XP vitalício vs ciclo atual.  
3. Iniciar `S-UX1` para explicitar “X de 8 cursos” + pendências individuais de trilha para pesquisador.  

### Sessão 2 — Finish migration discipline
1. Frontend reads from `operational_role` and `designations` only  
2. Timeline from `member_cycle_history`  
3. Cleanup SQL patches and validation  

### Sessão 3 — Product intelligence
1. PostHog iframe analytics route  
2. Looker Studio communications dashboard plan  
3. i18n internal pages and UX polish  

### Sessão 4 — Knowledge hub runway
1. Define knowledge asset schema  
2. Design `/workspace` relational views  
3. Preserve cross tribe visibility without turning the Hub into Miro chaos with prettier fonts

## Notes for the dev team

This backlog reflects a simple truth: some backend and hotfix work is already delivered while related UI and operational validation are still pending. Marking everything green because code landed somewhere is how teams accidentally summon chaos goblins.
